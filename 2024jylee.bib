  abstract = {COSINE-100 is a dark matter direct detection experiment with 106 kg NaI(Tl) as the target material. 210Pb and daughter isotopes are a dominant background in the WIMP region of interest and are detected via {$B$} decay and {$A$} decay. Analysis of the {$A$} channel complements the background model as observed in the {$B$}/{$\gamma$} channel. We present the measurement of the quenching factors and Monte Carlo simulation results and activity quantification of the {$A$} decay components of the COSINE-100 NaI(Tl) crystals. The data strongly indicate that the {$A$} decays probabilistically undergo two possible quenching factors but require further investigation. The fitted results are consistent with independent measurements and improve the overall understanding of the COSINE-100 backgrounds. Furthermore, the half-life of 216Po has been measured to be 143.4 {\textpm} 1.2 ms, which is consistent with and more precise than most current measurements.},

In previous   analyses, we achieved the same 1 keV energy threshold used in the   DAMA/LIBRA's analysis that reported an annual modulation signal with   11.6               {$\sigma$}               significance.  In this article, we report an improved   analysis that lowered the threshold to 0.7 keV, thanks to the   application of Multi-Layer Perception network and a new likelihood   parameter with waveforms in the frequency domain. The lower   threshold would enable a better comparison of COSINE-100 with new   DAMA results with a 0.75 keV threshold and account for differences   in quenching factors. Furthermore the lower threshold can enhance   COSINE-100's sensitivity to sub-GeV dark matter searches.},

Analyzing peaks from decays supported only by short-lived isotopes presented a unique challenge due to their limited statistics and overlapping energies, which was overcome by long-term data collection and a time-dependent analysis. A key achievement is the direct measurement of the 0.87~keV light yield, resulting from the cascade following electron capture decay of                                                   \$\${\textbackslash}mathrm \{{\textasciicircum}\{22\}Na\}\$\$                                                                                                                 22                                              Na                                                                                       from internal contamination. This measurement, previously accessible only indirectly, deepens our understanding of NaI(Tl) scintillator behavior in the region of interest for dark matter searches. This study holds substantial implications for background modeling and the interpretation of dark matter signals in NaI(Tl) experiments.},

The pilot stage of the experiment was conducted using {$\sim$}1.9 kg of 48deplCa100MoO4 crystals at the Yangyang Underground Laboratory, South Korea, from 2015 to 2018. We compared the measured {$B$}/{$\gamma$} energy spectra in three experimental configurations with the results of Monte Carlo simulations and identified the background sources in each configuration. We replaced several detector components and enhanced the neutron shielding to lower the background level between configurations. A limit on the half-life of 0{$\nuBB$} decay of100Mo was found at {$T$}10/{$\nu$}2 {$\geq$} 3.0 {\texttimes} 1023 years at 90\% confidence level, based on the measured background and its modeling.

To achieve this level, the rate of background signals arising from emissions produced by decays of radioactive impurities in the detector and shielding materials must be strictly controlled. To do this, concentrations of such impurities are measured and are controlled through materials selection and purification.
