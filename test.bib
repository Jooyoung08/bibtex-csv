   abstract = {Scintillating NaI(Tl) crystals are used for various rare decay experiments, such as dark matter searches. However, the hygroscopicity of NaI(Tl) crystals makes the construction of crystal detectors in these experiments challenging. Therefore, the crystal requires a tight encapsulation to prevent from air contact. More importantly, in a low radioactivity measurement, identification of external radiations and surface contamination is crucial to characterize the origin of total crystal radioactivities. Studies for the NaI(Tl) crystal encapsulation with active organic scintillator vetoes have been performed to mitigate the above-mentioned issues simultaneously. A bare crystal is directly coupled with liquid and plastic scintillators to tag external radiations that penetrate from the outer part of the crystal. We report the pulse shape discrimination between organic scintillator and the crystal scintillator in a single detector setup and their long-term stability.},

   abstract = {Advanced Molybdenum-based Rare process Experiment (AMoRE) searching neutrinoless double-beta ( 0νββ ) decay of 100Mo from 48deplCa100MoO4 (CMO) scintillation crystals has been preparing CMO crystals for the phase-I stage, AMoRE-I. Nine CMO crystals with a total weight of 3.39 kg were produced by the FOMOS-Materials in Russia and delivered to the Yangyang Underground Laboratory (Y2L) in South Korea for about 2 years until the end of 2016. Acceptance tests of all the nine crystals on weight, dimension, transmittance, light output, energy resolution, and internal radioactivities were completed in the middle of 2017. We have set the upper limits of internal radioactivity levels for 228Th, 226Ra, and 227Ac (daughters of 232Th, 238U, and 235U), and the total alpha activity of U/Th in the crystals via a GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulation to achieve zero background in region of interest. We used a delayed-coincidence analysis to separate the alphas from gamma background events. Results of the acceptance tests showed that all the crystals are qualified for the AMoRE-I. We will present the test results of the nine crystals together with a reference crystal.},

   abstract = {A calcium molybdate (CaMoO4) crystal scintillator, with molybdenum enriched in 100Mo and calcium depleted in 48Ca (40Ca100MoO4), was developed by the Advanced Molybdenum based Rare process Experiment (AMoRE) collaboration to search for a neutrinoless double beta (0ν β β) decay of 100Mo. We are planning to use about 10 kg of 40Ca100MoO4 crystals as cryogenic bolometers for the first phase of the experiment (AMoRE-I) at the Yang Yang underground laboratory (Y2L) in Korea. This experiment calls for an extremely low level of radioactive contamination in detectors, particularly by thorium, uranium, and radium decay chains. We measured scintillation properties and radioactive contamination of CaMoO4 and 40Ca100MoO4 crystals at the Y2L. We also estimated the acceptable level of internal radioactive background using Monte Carlo simulation for the AMoRE-I.},
